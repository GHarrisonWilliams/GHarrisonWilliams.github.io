		<p>Dear Sir,</p>
		<div>
			<p>Entering college, my initial goal was to pursue a degree in law, however as a rising junior at the University of Georgia, 
			I have found that my particular interests have been in the area of accounting. 
			Although my passion has remained in the field of law, I am currently seeking an undergraduate degree in accounting. 
			My aspirations in <em>accounting</em> were discovered while I was taking the first course in the field. 
			I desire to increase my exposure in both law and accounting, through the experience provided from an internship. 
			An internship will not only allow me to develop my strengths; it will also provide exposure to my emerging skills. 
			My ultimate goal is to be able to combine my interests in accounting with my enthusiasm for law. 
			The experience that an internship in either field will provide, would enable me to find the appropriate niche for my abilities. </p>

			<p>Success has always been a driving force in my life, fuelled by perseverance and the desire to achieve. 
			Strong character and moral ethics have always been an unwavering focal point in my life. 
			The overwhelming influence of my parents' religious and honest upbringing has guided me into a deep and abiding faith in God and a belief in the goodness of man. 
			They also instilled in me the self-esteem that allowed me to have the drive to reach for goals that seem improbable to attain. 
			Growing up in a household where I was constantly exposed to success and was praised from my own successes, I learned to value achievement with honor. 
			Achievement attained without honor becomes worthless and serves not good. I hope to be given the opportunity to prove myself as an important asset, with the use of these qualities. 
			It is my intention to work to the highest level that I can reach, for my own personal growth and the benefit of the company.</p>
			
			<p>Growing up in a small town in Northwest Georgia, I was provided with stability that allowed me to excel in all areas of my youth. 
			Although, unlikely, a child from Cartersville, Georgia would have the opportunity to experience a variety of cultures from around the world, my education opened the door to a vast number of cultural understandings. 
			Darlington school serves as a host to students from many foreign countries through their boarding program. 
			Through my extensive involvement in soccer I was able to travel and see, firsthand, the home lives of my peers from other countries. 
			I was also lucky enough to travel to the homes of many friends who live in vastly different cultures from my own. 
			These experiences have provided me with the understanding and ability needed to relate and work with people from all over the globe.</p>
		</div>

		<p>Sincerely,</p>
		<p></p>
